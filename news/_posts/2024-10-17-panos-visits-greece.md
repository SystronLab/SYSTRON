I recently had the opportunity to present *An Introduction to Continuous-variable Quantum Key Distribution* at the [University of Patras](https://www.upatras.gr/en/), where I shared insights into the advancements in quantum cryptography.

This talk highlighted the innovative approaches within continuous-variable systems and their applications in secure communication.

Engaging with fellow researchers and students in this exciting field was a rewarding experience, furthering our collective efforts in quantum communication at SYSTRON and the [Institute for Safe Autonomy (ISA)](https://www.york.ac.uk/safe-autonomy/) at University of York.
