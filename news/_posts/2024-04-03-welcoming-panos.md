We are delighted to welcome Dr Panos Papanastasiou to the SYSTRON Lab, working on the CHEDDAR project, the Communications Hub For Empowering Distributed ClouD Computing Applications And Research, funded by UKRI EPSRC.

Panos has a background working in quantum cryptography, and we are excited to have him joining us to work on enhancing network security by using hybrid settings of post-quantum cryptography and quantum key distribution protocols in wireless communications.
