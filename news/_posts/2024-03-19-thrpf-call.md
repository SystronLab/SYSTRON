EPSRC and DSIT have funded three future Telecoms Hubs and provided additional resources to bring them together in a federated structure, which will help deliver the six core areas identified in the Wireless Infrastructure Strategy. This structure brings together three existent EPSRC funded future telecoms platforms with new connecting infrastructure (JOINER). The three Hubs are:

- Communications Hub for Empowering Distributed clouD computing Applications and Research (CHEDDAR)
- PlaTform DrIving The UltimAte CoNnectivity (TITAN)
- Hub in All Spectrum Connectivity (HASC)

The Hubs are geared to address research challenges in three broad areas, namely, network-of-networks, wireless and wired spectrum and telco cloud & next generation computing for telecommunication. Additionally, as part of federated telecoms hub a Joint Open Infrastructure for Networks Research (JOINER) is also being developed to support collaborative experimentation and experimentation at scale across the Hubs’ research ecosystem and beyond.

## Call Overview

TITAN, HASC, and CHEDDAR have been allocated a £4m in total (£1.33m each (at 80% fEC)) to build joint work between members of the Hubs and new partners across the UK landscape to expand the research programme in alignment with the hubs’ objectives and to showcase first 6G trials and experiments.

## Scope

We particularly encourage projects that:

- Involve industrial partners, preferably as an active partner
- Bring in new expertise and institutions, not currently part of the Hubs
- Showcase early 6G experiments and trials using local Hub institutional facilities
- Make use of the JOINER infrastructure to enable collaborative research and drive national 6G pilots and other Hub institution facilities

The deadline for applications is Wednesday, April 17th, at 09:00 (UK time). Please see the call proposal and details here: https://cheddarhub.org/proposals/. As the University of York is part of the CHEDDAR Hub, if anyone has any informal queries regarding the proposal or any questions related to which research areas fit under which hub, reach out to our York CHEDDAR Lead, Dr Poonam Yadav (poonam.yadav@york.ac.uk).
