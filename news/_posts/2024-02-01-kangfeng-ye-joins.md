This month we are delighted to welcome Dr Kangfeng Ye to the SYSTRON Lab. He will be working on CHEDDAR: the Communications Hub For Empowering Distributed ClouD Computing Applications And Research - a UKRI EPSRC funded project.

The aim of the Hub is: "to facilitate the connection of UK excellence to encourage brave new ideas in Communications and Networking research that will ensure the UK lead in 6G technologies. This is an exciting new opportunity to join a national federation of communications hubs that include Titan and HASC Hubs."
