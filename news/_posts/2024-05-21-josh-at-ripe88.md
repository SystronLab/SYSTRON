A desire for stability, resiliency and predictability in inter-network routing make identifying changes in Internet architecture critical, exacerbated by growing digital sovereignty movements in countries across the globe. We present a new tool, combining data from a greater variety of sources and achieving higher completeness than existing state-of-the-art, which we intend to release in open source, providing researchers and network operators additional tooling to understand macroscopic connectivity. We analyse some of this data to find key patterns in nation states, presenting a phenomenon we describe as ‘funnelling’, wherein bottlenecks around states with higher Internet regulation or censorship, or with geographic detachment, have measurable deficiencies in connectivity - demonstrating a relationship between the shape of the Internet and geopolitical factors. In summary, our presentation presents an approach to Internet topology collection and measurement utilising publicly available Internet data (including from the RIPE NCC), alongside notable insight and results.
