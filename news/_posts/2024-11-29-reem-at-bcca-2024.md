Reem Alhabib recently presented her work on the impact of customised and tailored endorsement policies on the hyperledger fabric at the [Sixth International Conference on Blockchain Computing and Applications (BCCA 2024)](https://bcca-conference.org/2024/index.php) in Dubai, UAE.

## Abstract

In Hyperlegder Fabric (HLF), the endorsement policy (EP) could be tailored to each application, specifying the necessary approvals from the endorser peers of the participating organizations. Consequently, customization is often essential to ensure the transaction validation process meets the applicationâ€™s unique security and business needs. We implemented the network with default and customised EP in the platform we designed to share Autonomous vehicle (AV) data. In this work, we evaluate the impact of the customized EP on the platform performance. The observations indicate a positive effect on the success rate but a slight increase in latency and a decrease in throughput.
