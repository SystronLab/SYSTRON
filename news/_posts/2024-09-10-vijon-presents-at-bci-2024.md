The paper itself, titled: "Blockchain-based decentralised marketplace for secure trading of intellectual property", will soon be published in an upcoming volume of [Springer's "Communications in Computer and Information Science"](https://www.springer.com/series/7899) book series.

## About the presentation

This paper presents the development and implementation of a secure, web-based decentralised marketplace for trading intellectual property (IP). By leveraging blockchain technology, this marketplace eliminates the need for intermediaries, fostering a transparent, cost-effective, and unbiased trading environment. The proposed system ensures transaction integrity and confidentiality of the traded artefacts. The key contributions include the design of a robust security protocol, the implementation of smart contracts, and the application of multiple encryption schemes to enhance security. The research underscores the potential of blockchain to revolutionise the trading of intangible creations by providing a secure and efficient platform.
