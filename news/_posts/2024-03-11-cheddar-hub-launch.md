Our EPSRC/DSIT funded CHEDDAR Hub inaugural in-person kick-off meeting took place at the University of York's Institute of Safe Autonomy (ISA) building on Monday, March 11th. Led by Prof Julie McCann, the CHEDDAR Hub brings together 65 core team members from across six universities, pooling interdisciplinary expertise to tackle the challenges of federated telecoms and communications.

The atmosphere was electric, with positive and collaborative energies driving the day forward and sparking many exciting ideas. One highlight was the EDI (Equality, Diversity, and Inclusion) panel on "Embracing Inclusivity," chaired by Dr Carol Marsh OBE. Joined by inspiring panelists Rachael Fox, Amy Straker, Katy Deacon, and Maryam Hafeez, we delved into key ideas for building inclusive teams and cultures within the Cheddar project and beyond.

It was a day filled with passion, innovation, and a shared commitment to collaborative advancement in our field. We're thrilled to embark on this journey together and can't wait for our next meeting to showcase our research progress. Thanks to all University leads and their teams for making it a good start!
