The SYSTRON Lab recently held a successful two-day workshop, with one day focussing on on 6G communications. The event took place on Wednesday, 20th-21st November the Piazza Building.

The workshop attracted a keen audience interested in the latest advancements in 6G technology. Dr Poonam Yadav kicked off the event with a warm welcome and introduction, followed by brief introductions from Dr Rob Davis and Dr Arjuna Sathiaseelan - two experienced academics who have recently joined the group.

The agenda offered a diverse range of presentations, showcasing both the group's ongoing research projects, CHEDDAR and REMOTE, and the many areas of research encapsulated within that space. Vijon Baraku's "Data Capsule" presentation sparked discussions on blockchain and GDPR, while Dr Kavan Fatehi delved into "Deep Reinforcement Learning Based Resource Allocation Approach for Wireless Networks."

Security and network performance were key themes throughout the day. Dr Kangfeng Ye's talk explored "The Use of Formal Verification in Security Protocols and QoS Analysis for O-RAN Applications," while Dr Olufemi Olayiwola (from the colocated Institute for Safe Autonomy) addressed "6G Energy Benchmarking."

The afternoon session focused on cutting-edge topics like Digital Twins for communication systems (Ahsan Raza Khan), secure communication with "CV-QKD for Constrained Scenarios" (Dr Panos Papanastasiou), and network vulnerabilities in Thread/Matter networks (Anthony Moulds & Peter Gillingham).

Rehab Alawadh presented a "Hybrid Intelligent Fast Failure Recovery Framework for Enhanced Resilience in Software Defined Networks," followed by a presentation on the impact of blockchain technology (Reem Alhabib).

The workshop provided a valuable platform for researchers and industry professionals to share knowledge, explore new ideas, and foster collaboration in the exciting field of 6G communications, which ended with a meal for all workshop participants and the SYSTRON Lab members in York City Centre.
