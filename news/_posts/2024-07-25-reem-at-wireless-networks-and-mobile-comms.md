## About the presentation

Advancements in wireless communication, encompassing cellular and non-terrestrial networks, are empowering Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) to revolutionize transportation. The achievement of real-time data exchange and seamless communication with infrastructure promises a future of safer and more efficient travel. However, the significant challenge of efficiently managing the extensive data generated by AVs persists. This data includes sensor readings, information about the surrounding environment, and potentially user data. Consequently, addressing concerns related to data processing, sharing among various stakeholders, privacy, integrity, and security is of utmost importance. This paper tackles the data sharing challenge by proposing and evaluating a platform built on Hyperledger Fabric, a blockchain technology. This platform aims to facilitate secure and efficient data sharing between all parties involved with AVs. Our initial testing reveals that the number of simulated users (virtual user count) and the amount of data processed (data load) can negatively impact the systemâ€™s performance. This highlights the need for further optimization to ensure the platform can handle large-scale data sharing effectively.
