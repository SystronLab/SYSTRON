Autonomous vehicles (AV) systems make driving decisions using data from sensors and cameras, crucial for later processes such as validation, improvement, training, and addressing accident legal liability. Thus, this data is crucial for various stakeholders such as government, owners, and insuance providers. Accordingly, in this work, a Hyperledger based solution has been implemented enabling Attribute-BasedAccess Control (ABAC) for efficient data-sharing.
