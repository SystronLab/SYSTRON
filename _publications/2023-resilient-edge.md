Edge computing has gained attention in recent years due to the adoption of many Internet of Things (IoT) applications in domestic, industrial and wild settings. The resiliency and reliability requirements of these applications vary from non-critical (best delivery efforts) to safety-critical with time-bounded guarantees. The network connectivity of IoT edge devices remains the central critical component that needs to meet the time-bounded Quality of Service (QoS) and fault-tolerance guarantees of the applications. Therefore, in this work, we systematically investigate how to meet IoT applications mixed-criticality QoS requirements in multi-communication networks. We (i) present the network resiliency requirements of IoT applications by defining a system model (ii) analyse and evaluate the bandwidth, latency, throughput, maximum packet size of many state-of-the-art LPWAN technologies, such as Sigfox, LoRa, and LTE (CAT-M1/NB-IoT) and Wi-Fi, (iii) implement and evaluate an adaptive system Resilient Edge and Criticality-Aware Best Fit (CABF) resource allocation algorithm to meet the application resiliency requirements using Raspberry Pi 4 and Pycom FiPy development board having five multi-communication networks. We present our findings on how to achieve 100% of the best-effort high criticality level message delivery using multi-communication networks.
