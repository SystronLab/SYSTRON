In Hyperlegder Fabric (HLF), the endorsement policy (EP) could be tailored to each application, specifying the necessary approvals from the endorser peers of the participating organizations. Consequently, customization is often essential to ensure the transaction validation process meets the applicationâ€™s unique security and business needs. We implemented the network with default and customised EP in the platform we designed to share Autonomous vehicle (AV) data. In this paper, we evaluate the impact of the customized EP on the platform performance. The observations indicate a positive effect on the success rate but a slight increase in latency and a decrease in throughput.
