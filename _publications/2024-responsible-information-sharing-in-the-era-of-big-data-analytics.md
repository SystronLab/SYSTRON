In the contemporary digital landscape, the intersection of big data analytics, data ownership, and GDPR compliance emerges as a critical arena. This paper proposes a transformative framework to redefine data control, shifting ownership from entities such as Data Controllers to individuals. Central to this innovation is the proposed novel and disruptive concept of the Data Capsule, empowering individuals to effectively own and thus dictate terms and conditions for their data usage. The Data Capsule framework draws on ontologies, semantic technologies, and blockchain to homogenise heterogeneous data, automate annotation, enforce governance rules, and ensure transparency. By making individuals primary custodians of their data, this paper aims to provide privacy, security, and ethical data handling, counteracting the potential pitfalls of profit-driven practices.

This paper outlines a comprehensive research plan, provides a state-of-the-art review, and shows aligning objectives with the system workflow.
