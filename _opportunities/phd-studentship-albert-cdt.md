## Research Hypothesis

ARL environments are complex systems that require continuous, time-critical communication among autonomous components, such as mobile robots, to perform independent actions. In the best-case scenario, the system is assumed to work as designed. In contrast, in the worst-case scenario, it is assumed that the communication failure of a single component may halt the entire system, compromising efficiency and safety. However, we hypothesise that in real-world environments, ARL systems may partially work, without complete failure. This can affect the judgement and behaviour of lab technicians and assistants who are automating experiments using human-robot interactions. For example, they may choose to continue the experiment or stop the entire operation. Therefore, in this research work, we would like to explore the effects of human behaviour on ARL operations and quantify communication uncertainties in domain-specific (e.g., chemistry) robot-robot and human-robot interactions.

## Background Context

Robot failures in generic settings have been researched in recent years [1, 3]. However, with the advancement of autonomous systems, more detailed research and understanding of failures and their different impacts (functional, safety, social, psychological, and emotional) in specialised settings and environments is needed. Wireless and wired communication are critical components of distributed robotic systems and play a vital role in the system's resilience and robustness [2]. However, wireless failures have been studied from the technical (functional, security) point of view, and there is still a lack of research on how they impact other robots and humans within the system, especially in domain-specific lab settings. Additionally, the literature does not clearly define the best methodology for measuring all impacts. For example, how long do the impacts last? How long do humans in the lab remain in a more conscious mode after a robot's delayed action or complete stop? Therefore, this is an interesting research direction worth exploring to build smart autonomous lab environments.

## Research Objectives

1. **Identification and Characterisation of Communication Uncertainties**: Consider different communication modalities in ARL, such as visual cues, auditory signals, and haptic feedback. Explore potential sources of uncertainties, including signal delay, packet loss, and ambiguities in robot-human communication.
2. **Effects on Human Judgment and Behavior**: Clearly define metrics for judgment and behaviour, such as response time, decision accuracy, and emotional responses. Develop scenarios that simulate communication uncertainties to observe how lab technicians and assistants respond in realistic situations.
3. **Recording Human Perceptions, Attention, and Emotions**: Utilise sensors and recording devices to capture sound and image data during human-robot interactions. Employ eye-tracking technology to monitor attention and emotion recognition systems to gauge emotional responses.
4. **Data Processing and Analysis Using Machine Learning**: Implement machine learning algorithms to process and analyse the collected data. Train models to recognise patterns in human behaviour correlated with communication uncertainties.
5. **Subjective Experiences and Feelings of Safety and Confidence**: Include surveys, interviews, or qualitative methods to gather subjective feedback from lab technicians and assistants. Analyse subjective experiences alongside objective data to gain a holistic understanding of the impact of communication uncertainties.
6. **Strategies for Mitigation**: Propose and test strategies for mitigating negative effects, such as improved communication protocols, redundancy mechanisms, or adaptive algorithms. Evaluate the effectiveness of these strategies in real-world ARL scenarios.
7. **Ethical Considerations**: Address ethical considerations related to human-robot interaction, data privacy, and the psychological impact of uncertainties on participants.

## Methodology

This research will use a mixed-methods approach. The qualitative phase of the study will involve conducting interviews and focus groups with lab technicians and assistants who have worked in ARL environments. The quantitative phase of the study will involve conducting experiments to investigate the effects of communication uncertainties on human judgement and behaviour.

## Significance

This research is significant because it will provide new insights into the effects of communication uncertainties on human behaviour in ARL environments. These insights can be used to develop strategies for improving the safety and efficiency of ARL operations.
