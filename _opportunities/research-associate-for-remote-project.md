The Department of Computing Science is seeking a Research Associate to contribute to and take a leading role in the EPSRC-funded project “REMOTE: Resilient and Secure Multi-Access Interoperable Communication Fabric for TinyEdge,” working with Dr Poonam Yadav (University of York) and the project's industrial and academic partners. The ideal candidate will have expertise in computer networks, security, wireless communication, and edge computing.

The REMOTE project aims to develop a secure, robust, open-source communication infrastructure for Edge IoT networks. TinyEdge is an innovative edge computing platform that provides a decentralised, secure, and scalable infrastructure for deploying applications at the network edge. The project will tackle interoperability challenges within Edge IoT networks, ensuring seamless communication across diverse devices and protocols. The goal is to create a solution integrating multiple communication protocols while ensuring redundancy, availability, and resilience in communication pathways.
