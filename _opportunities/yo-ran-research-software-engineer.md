To support ongoing research projects, the Department is seeking Research Software Engineers (RSE).

The RSE will focus on open networking and the development of the RAN Intelligent Controller (RIC), encompassing the creation of xApps and rApps and the exploration of security requirements.

In this role, active participation in an Open RAN research project is anticipated, with an additional expectation to contribute to scientific publications and demonstrations. Support will be provided by the investigators and senior members of the team, fostering close collaboration with industry partners.

## Department 

The Computer Science department at the University of York enjoys a distinguished reputation in the fields of teaching, research, and industry engagement. It has a proven track record of success in research, as demonstrated by its impressive 11th and 12th rankings in the UK for Computer Science in the recent Research Excellence Framework (REF) and the Complete University Guide 2023, respectively.

The department co-leads the EPSRC funded Communications Hub for empowering distributed cloud computing applications and research and collaborates closely on many projects with the School of Physics, Engineering, and Technology.  The School of Physics, Engineering, and Technology has recently secured very substantial funding for several wireless communications projects focussing on Open RAN for next generation radio access networks. YO-RAN, a £7.3M collaborative project led by York, has recently started funding by the UK Government, Department of Digital, Science Innovation and Technology as part of its Future Open Networks Research Challenge.  Alongside YO-RAN a new, York-led £5.1M project has recently been awarded on O-RAN funded by the UK Government.
