Our lab is based at the University of York, and uses facilities based in buildings in York, as well as at the University of York's Europe Campus at City College, Thessaloniki.

# The Ian Wand Building

Located on University of York Campus East, the Ian Wand Building is the home of the University of York's Computer Science Department. We have offices in this space, as well as access to specialist research labs, inclusing the SASS lab.

# Institute for Safe Autonomy (ISA)

Also located on Campus East, the ISA building is a new Â£15m purpose-built facility with experimental laboratories for robotics, advanced communications and quantum technologies, including separate networks for robotic and autonomous systems.

This also has a number of [test spaces](https://www.york.ac.uk/safe-autonomy/facilities/laboratories-and-test-spaces/).
