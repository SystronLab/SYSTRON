## Project Description

The project focuses on developing scalable, privacy-preserving, and energy-efficient machine learning (ML) frameworks tailored for diverse data-driven applications. With the growing reliance on ML models in real-world applications, challenges such as compliance with privacy regulations like GDPR, managing computational complexity, and addressing security vulnerabilities have become critical. This research aims to leverage neuromorphic computing and TinyML to enhance scalability, integrate federated learning for privacy-aware distributed model training, and design robust aggregation mechanisms to ensure security and resilience against adversarial threats. This project aspires to create innovative frameworks that are computationally efficient and adaptable to various data-driven domains, such as wireless communication systems, energy forecasting, and smart healthcare.

## Current Challenges in Data-Driven Applications

The increasing adoption of data-driven applications presents significant challenges in balancing model complexity, data privacy, and security. Compliance with privacy regulations, such as GDPR, demands that sensitive user data remain decentralised, leading to a need for distributed learning techniques like federated learning. However, these approaches often struggle with high computational overhead and inefficient device communication, especially when handling large-scale models. Furthermore, adversarial attacks that exploit model training and aggregation vulnerabilities increasingly target deep learning systems, compromising security and reliability. These challenges highlight the need for scalable, secure, and privacy-aware ML frameworks that efficiently operate in distributed and resource-constrained environments.

## Objectives

1. To design scalable and energy-efficient ML frameworks leveraging neuromorphic computing for distributed data-driven applications.

2. To develop privacy-aware learning mechanisms using federated learning that comply with regulations like GDPR while ensuring minimal communication overhead.

3. To enhance security and robustness in distributed learning through novel aggregation mechanisms that mitigate adversarial attacks and noisy updates.
