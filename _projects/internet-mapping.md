desc: Exploring Internet architecture to improve Internet routing protocols.
---

Heightened interest from nation states to perform content censorship make it evermore critical to identify the impact of censorship efforts on the Internet. We undertake a study of Internet architecture, capturing the state of Internet topology with greater completeness than existing state-of-the-art.

There are a small number of nation states that do not follow this trend, for which we provide an analysis and explanation, demonstrating a relationship between geographical factors in addition to geopolitics. In summary, our work provides a deeper understanding of how these censorship measures impact the overall functioning and dynamics of the Internet.

## Codebase

*Pending release*. We hope to publish the code from our Internet topology fusion tool, responsible for the multi-source data collection, in the coming days.
