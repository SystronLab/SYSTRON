In our pursuit of advancing AV technology, we recognize the critical need for a robust data sharing infrastructure. Our work focuses on leveraging Hyperledger Fabric to develop a platform aimed at enhancing data sharing in autonomous vehicle (AV) systems. With a primary goal of ensuring security and efficiency, our platform addresses key challenges in the AV ecosystem.

Objectives
-Fine-Grained Access Control: Implementing Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC) to regulate data access based on user attributes, ensuring secure and controlled sharing.
-Performance Evaluation: Conducting thorough assessments to measure the platforms performance under varying virtual user counts and data loads, with a focus on user experience and scalability.

This Hyperledger Fabric platform represents a step forward in addressing data sharing challenges within the AV domain. By combining security, efficiency, and scalability, we aim to contribute to the seamless integration of autonomous vehicles into our daily lives.
