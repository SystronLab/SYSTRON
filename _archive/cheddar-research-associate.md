Applications are solicited for a Postdoctoral Research Associate position within the Computer Science department at the University of York.

Funded by UKRI EPSRC, the project "CHEDDAR: Communications Hub For Empowering Distributed ClouD Computing Applications And Research" aims to enhance distributed cloud computing applications and cultivate innovative research ideas for advancing research and networking within the UK academic community.

The aim of the Hub is to facilitate the connection of UK excellence to encourage brave new ideas in Communications and Networking research that will ensure the UK lead in 6G technologies. This is an exciting new opportunity to join a national federation of communications hubs that include Titan and HASC Hubs. Together we generate world-leading research, while growing via project and platform funding.

The department collaborates closely on numerous projects with the School of Physics, Engineering, and Technology. It recently secured substantial funding for several wireless communications projects, focusing on:

1. Autonomous Distribution of Intelligence Across Cloud-Native Radio Access Network Implementation
2. Incorporating Multi-access Edge Computing (MEC) into the framework of 6G and future communication.
3. Trustworthy AI for Automating Ultra-Large Network Optimisation, focusing on Human-in-the-Loop Approach and Explainability and Interpretability.
4. Verify the advanced protocols of 5G formally, providing insights to ensure the verifiability of 6G.
5. Ensuring the Privacy of Network Intelligence within the context of 6G and upcoming network technologies.
6. Addressing Emerging Threats and Security in the Post-Quantum Era.

The Postdoctoral Research Associate is expected to work on one of these projects and the potential candidate provides their preference in the cover letter.
